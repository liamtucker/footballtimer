# rota

## What this is

A display for casual six-a-side. It says who is in goal and who is the sub, for
both teams, and it changes on a timer. Set up during the warm-up, then never
touched.

`spec.md` is the source of truth for behaviour. `plan.md` is the build order.
`README.md` says why it exists. Read all three before you change anything.

## Rules

1. **The rotation is a pure function of elapsed time.** `rotation.js` holds no
   clock, no state and no history. Same setup and same elapsed time always
   returns the same answer. This is what lets a dead phone restart and carry on.
2. **No build step.** Flat static files. Vanilla JS, no framework, no bundler,
   no dependencies. Opening `index.html` runs it.
3. **No backend and no accounts.** The only stored things are the setup and the
   kick-off timestamp, in `localStorage`.
4. **Nothing to operate mid-game.** Two exceptions only: add a late arrival, and
   mark a player gone home. Both are facts, not decisions. Do not add a third.
5. **A button that needs a judgement is the wrong button.** Check any new
   control against the four principles in `spec.md`.
6. **System fonts only.** No webfont loads on a pitch with no signal.
7. Run `node test.js` before every commit. It must pass.

## Decisions

- **Hosting.** GitHub Pages, from `main` at the repo root.
- **Target.** Landscape phone, iOS Safari and Android Chrome both.
- **Gone home.** In scope. The spec's open decision is settled — allow it.
- **Squad memory.** The last squad is kept and prefilled at setup. A setup
  convenience only. It never touches the rotation.

## State

**Done.** Nothing yet.

**Next.** Rotation engine, then setup screen, then display, then announcement,
then wake lock and restore, then the two roster taps.

**Blocked.** Nothing.
